# Pathfinding
Pathfinding C#
The solution contains two seperate projects:
- "Pathfinding_OnePassAlgorthim" which generates and calculates a path on a optimised search space using maze enviroments generated 
    from bitmaps
- "Pathfinding_Altitudes" returns a bitmap showing the shortest path in different terrains generated using a height map from a 
    grey-scale bitmap.
